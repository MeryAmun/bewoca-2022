It was a great time to learn and exchange ideas On family planing and the Rights of adolescents to their reproductive health. Many adolescents don't have the right knowledge of contraceptives and how to use them correctly. Others are considered bad children and are afraid to go for contraceptives for fear of being shunned by the people who sell them. When adolescents are educated about their sexuality, they turn to practice safe sex they by preventing unwanted pregnancies and STI's and in most cases abstain from sexual intercourse as they are aware of the consequences of premarital sex. We also got to interact with an meet amazing people. Thanks you Youth2Youth for this platform to come together and share ideas."

        title:"Partnerships", date:"", image:partner1, text:"The on going crisis in the North West and South West Region of Cameroon has forced many victims to flee to neighboring counties, while others are fleeing to safer zones of moving to other communities. Nyeneba is a village located in the South West Region of Cameroon Manyu division precisely in Tinto Subdivision upper Bayang. With an estimated population of about 5000 people.The main occupation of the people is subsistence agriculture which has been hampered by the ongoing crisis in Cameroon. Before the crisis Nyeneba has never had a health center, just a dispensary. Which has been made worst with the ongoing crisis in North West and South West Region of Cameroon. With the absence of health care facilities, and inaccessible roads caused by the crisis, the population registered and increase in infant mortality rate, infanticide outbreaks like, typhoid, Colerrohea , dysentery, Malaria, anemia, influenza, communicable and non communicable diseases, trauma as a result of the on going crisis. The most vulnerable people being children, pregnant women, person's with disabilities, old people and internally displaced person's. Atakem Zephaniah Tambo is a physically challenged person from this Community who being displaced himself went back to his village after studying to become a lab technician. He took upon himself the initiative to start a small mud Clinic popularly called Zambo's clinic. This clinic is in a mud house which is serving the people of this Community for the past one year. It is against this background that Think Big organization which is a registered organization in Partnership with Better World Community and Advocacy Organization has taken the initiative of identifying these problems and seeking solutions for them. The project seeks to create awareness to the daire needs and plight of the people of the community of Nyeneba. It is envisaged that upon completion of project, mortality rate, infant mortality rate and infanticide will be greatly reduced. That more than least 80% of the population would have access to good health. Problem statement Poor health facility with inaccessibility of drugs and insufficient equipments. There's a saying that health is wealth, but this has not been the case of the people of Nyeneba Community who in the past often resorted to traditional healers and only moved to another village to get medical help in critical situations. The outbreak of war in the North West and South West Region made matter's worst as there is insecurity, poverty, hunger, constant road blocks. Inacessability of drugs, insufficient Lab equipments, electricity, transport and Communication. A structure since the clinic is in a mud house. Medical equipment such as bio chemistry machines, Ultrasound, x-ray , Hemoglobin meter, glucose meter, oxygen meter, themometer, scale, lab reagents, stretchers, wheel chairs, mosquito nets to name a few. Retionale Significance This project seeks to improve the life of the people of the community of Nyeneba village through the provision of a better health facility and access to good health care. As a humanitarian organization we are also looking forward to start a community school on a piece of land which was giving by the community against a token we offered with the hope of building a modern clinic, a school, and orphanage and a Chapel. Education has been greatly affected by the ongoing crisis. Putting into consideration the four principles of humanitarian action, our attention is empathy, were we focus on improving the health care for all in this locality though not putting a blind eye to the other plights like lack of a school,portable water and electricity.

            title:"Violence", date:"7th October 2020", image:activities2, text:"Rape is having sex with someone without their consent, final full stop. Whether the person is your spouse or a prostitute does not annul the need for them to consent. That a lady cuddles with you,and allows you to caress her body doesn't mean you must have sex with her.Therefore if after all the cuddling, caressing and kissing she says she's not going any further, she is well within her rights. Everyone has the right to physical integrity (body) and moral integrity (image),  and there is no justification for a violation of any such rights.  People get raped by rapists,if there are no rapist there won't be rape. Priest rape children, father's rape their daughters, brothers, rape sisters, cousins, uncles and the list goes on.. According to rainn.org, an online platform giving statistics on victims of sexual violence, EIGHT OUT OF EVERY TEN RAPE VICTIMS KNEW THE RAPIST. So when the rape topic comes up and we begin by talking about how women dress, or the fact that they go out on dates with men,  its a very naive perspective. Naive because rape is not like tripping on a stone and falling... It is often premeditated, calculated and planned. If indecent dressing was the cause of rape, women would have been raped in broad day light, in public places... Children aged one have been raped, so how do you justify the act? Where they dressed indecently, the answer is no. Yes we encourage decent dressing but that shouldn't be use as a justifiable reason for Rape. Rape is perpetrated by sick people who have been misinformed about what sex is,and who have no respect for a woman's body."

Rape is becoming rampant in our society, and as we come together to put an end to Rape, we need to address another important issue. We live in a digital age, almost everyone has access to mobile phones and take pictures of breaking news. In cases of abuse or rape, It's okay to take pictures and videos of the act or the perpetrator for legal purposes. But we have to consider the victims. The damages people suffer from Abuse or rape is overwhelming already, it's very important to blur the faces of the victims especially when they are children involved. Apprehending a culprit is the first step to healing for victims, We sometimes expose victims or Children to greater danger when we share pictures or videos showing their faces. These victims suffer double jupardy as they are further labeled and stigmatized by their peers or some people in the society. Let's do the right thing, let's protect victims of abuse because they are already suffering from the abuse and from people who are insensitive to their plight. If you must take a video/ picture, or post such information please kindly blure their faces. It's a painful process already let's not in trying to do good make it worst by being insensitive. As you make your voice heard, in the fight against domestic violence, be careful not to expose victims or survivor's to greater danger and abuse."
